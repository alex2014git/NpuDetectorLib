# NpuDetectorLib

This is just one hailo NPU Detector library for hailo inference.

**Note:**

- We use code from the Hailo official GitHub repository: https://github.com/hailo-ai/Hailo-Application-Code-Examples.
- For some third-party libraries, we've copied the header files directly into this repo for convenience.
